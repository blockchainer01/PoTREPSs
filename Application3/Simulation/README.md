# Simulation Code and Simulation Instructions

This is the simulation code for **Application 3** and the corresponding instructions to run it.

## Requirements

MATLAB software is properly installed.

## Run procedure

* Step 1. Run the file "Initialize.m" in the folder "Main System".
* Step 2. Run the file "MainSystem.m" in the folder "Main System".



##  See the results directly

Since the evolution of the system also has been run in advance, you can view the regulation process directly from the figure below or by clicking on the picture "MicrogridOutput.gif" in the folder "Application3".
