# Simulation Code and Simulation Instructions

This is the simulation code for **Application 2** and the corresponding instructions to run it.

## Files


## Requirements
MATLAB software is properly installed and optimization solvers cplex, gurobi, xpress, copt, mosek are added.

## Run procedure

* Step 1. Run the file "Main.m" in the folder "Cal_cons".
* Step 2. Move the generated parameter data "cons.mat" to the folder "Main System".
* Step 3. Run the file "MainSystem.m" in the folder "Main System".

## Simplified procedure:
Since the calculation of parameters has been conducted in advance, Step 3 can be performed directly.

## See the results directly:
Since the evolution of the system also has been run in advance, you can watch the regulation process directly by clicking on the picture "StateResponses.gif" in the folder "Main System".
